# 📰 fine-tuned-distilBERT-for-news-classification

A transformer-based multiclass text classification model fine-tuned on the AG News dataset to predict the topic category of a given news headline or article. This project demonstrates end-to-end model development using Hugging Face Transformers, from dataset preparation to deployment with a Gradio-powered web demo.

## 📝 Project Description: `ag-news-text-classifier-huggingface`

> A transformer-based multiclass text classification model fine-tuned on the AG News dataset to predict the topic category of a given news headline or article. This project demonstrates end-to-end model development using Hugging Face Transformers, from dataset preparation to deployment with a Gradio-powered web demo.

## 💡 Overview

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained language model (`DistilBERT`) to classify news text into one of four categories:

* 🌍 **World**
* ⚽ **Sports**
* 📈 **Business**
* ⚛️ **Sci/Tech**

Using the [AG News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news), the model learns to predict the topic of a given news headline or short article with high accuracy.
