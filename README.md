# fine-tuned-bert-for-news-classification
A transformer-based multiclass text classification model fine-tuned on the AG News dataset to predict the topic category of a given news headline or article. This project demonstrates end-to-end model development using Hugging Face Transformers, from dataset preparation to deployment with a Gradio-powered web demo.

## 💡 Overview

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained language model (DistilBERT or BERT) to classify news text into one of four categories:

* **World**
* **Sports**
* **Business**
* **Sci/Tech**

Using the [AG News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news), the model learns to predict the topic of a given news title and description with high accuracy.
